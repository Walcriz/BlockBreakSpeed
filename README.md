# BlockBreakSpeed
A **semi** drop-in replacement for **Breaker2** that uses potion effects to minimize desync/packets sent between server and client.

## Benefits
- It sends way less packets to the client (*the reason this was made*)
- Reduces chances of desync between server and client (*Needs more testing*)

## Drawbacks
- Since BlockBreakSpeed relies on potion effects it **cannot** make unbreakable blocks breakable.
- This plugin requires **ProtocolLib** to function
- It does not include all features that **Breaker2** offers. It is very limited in scope. Such features may include:
  - **Exact** break time (*It will estimate*)
  - All state modifiers/trigger providers supported by **Breaker2**

## Issues & Pull requests
- If you have found an issue please create a new issue with a fitting name.
- Feel free to create a pull request if you feel a feature is missing.

## REMEMBER
THIS PLUGIN MAY NOT RECIEVE SUPPORT OF ANY KIND!
